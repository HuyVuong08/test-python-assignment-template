These files define how tests run on push or PR. There are sample templates teachers use — check other Classroom starter repos for examples.:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## 🧠 After these changes

Once you:

✔ add real starter code + tests  
✔ enable **Template repository**  
✔ push commits to `main`

Anyone in your organization can click **Use this template** and create a starter repo that includes all files. That new repo is independent, with its own history.:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

If you want, I can **generate a full commit patch** (file contents) for you — just tell me what the assignment should *do* (e.g., what the Python code is supposed to solve).
